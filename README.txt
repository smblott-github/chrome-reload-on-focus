Reload a Page on Focus
----------------------

This is a very simple Chrome extension to reload a page (tab) whenever it
receives the focus.

It is targeted at developers who edit a bit, and then return to their
browser to test their work.

A list of RegExps can be configured on the options page; only pages which
match one of these Javascript RegExps are reloaded.  The default is just
"file://.*".
